I like maths, coding, pubs, travel, basketball, guitar, singing, chess and most recently, cycling. I build things that I think are interesting and I like to talk about it.

I'm always up for a chat over a coffee or beer - just get in touch.

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Vortexa](https://www.vortexa.com/) where I use machine learning to try to predict what's on boats, how much of it is on there and where it's going to.

I completed the first year of a PhD at the University of Oxford where I was trying to predict antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections before deciding academia wasn't where I wanted to go with my life.

Previously I studied Mathematical Modelling & Scientific Computing at Oxford and Mathematics at the University of Bath. Somewhere in the middle of that I worked as a Software Engineer at [Nested](https://nested.com/) and [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/).
