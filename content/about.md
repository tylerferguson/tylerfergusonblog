I like maths, coding, pubs, travel, basketball, guitar, singing, chess and most recently, cycling. I build things that I think are interesting and I like to talk about it. 

I'm always up for a chat over a coffee or beer - just get in touch.

I''m currently working on a [PhD at the University of Oxford where I try to predict antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections](https://amrtraining.ac.uk/about/second-cohort/). 

Previously I studied Mathematical Modelling & Scientific Computing at Oxford and Mathematics at the University of Bath. Somewhere in the middle of that I worked as a Software Engineer at [Nested](https://nested.com/) and [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/).
