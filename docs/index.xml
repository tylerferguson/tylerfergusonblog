      <description>They say eating red meat causes cancer. They’re saying you shouldn’t swim in rivers anymore. They say vaccines cause autism.
We’ve all heard these conversational opening gambits before. Big, bold statements that catch the eye and encourage you to jump straight to a hasty conclusion. But why is it that stuff like this is always uttered by them? And just who are they?

      <description>Prior to the 2002–03 NBA season the first round of the NBA Playoffs was a best of 5 format. It had been this way since the 1984 season (a year that&amp;rsquo;s been coming up an awful lot lately with a certain documentarycoming out). Before 1984 the league had experimented with a few different formats. But the post-1984 format is very familiar to us all: 4 rounds in the playoffs, each round is a best of 7 series.</description>

      <description>This one actually. I have no set plan for content but I do have some goals.
I want to share my thoughts on a whole bunch of topics with others. Not because they&amp;rsquo;re particularly insightful, but because I have lots of them that never make the cut for a real human conversation. I&amp;rsquo;m getting bored of being my own captive audience and now I want to make you miserable too.</description>
